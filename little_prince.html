            <p>As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and set out walking once more. 
                <span class="underline">I felt deeply moved, and stirred.</span> 
                <span class="underline">It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure.</span> 
                <span class="highlight-orange">It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth.</span> 
                In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I said to myself: 
                <span class="red-text">"What I see here is nothing but a shell. What is most important is invisible..."</span> 
                As his lips opened slightly with the suspicion of a half-smile, I said to myself, again: 
                <span class="red-text">"What moves me so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a flower--the image of a rose 
                that shines through his whole being like the flame of a lamp, even when he is asleep..."</span> 
                And I felt him to be more fragile still. 
                <span class="underline">I felt the need of protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that might be extinguished by a little puff of wind...</span>
